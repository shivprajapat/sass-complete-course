## Examples in Each Chapter

Our "Show Sass" tool makes it easy to learn Sass, it shows both the code and the result.

## What You Should Already Know

Before you continue you should have a basic understanding of the following:

HTML

CSS

## What is Sass?

 Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet

 Sass is an extension to CSS

 Sass is a CSS pre-processor

 Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS

 Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time

 Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006

 Sass is free to download and use

## Why Use Sass?

Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.

Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.

npm install -g sass
